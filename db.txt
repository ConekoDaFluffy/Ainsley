kitty encounter at a place i went to
hey guys, guess what?
today is gha's birthday
i originally created the channels for me and the other 3 so we could like show stuff we made or found and stuff like that without the regular house members interfering
dunno what that is but i don't think it's good
isn't it kinda not very cool to show other people somebody's dms without permission ?
yea that too but i was referencing something
and i'm sorry to say that i didn't enjoy it very much !!!
i hope you will feel better soon !!
uhhh is it bad if i don't know what else to say
we haven't said anything here since last month ( a whole four days that's so wild i know ) but uhhh just wanna say I hope you're doing well rn and that you are currently safe and happy :3
but uhhh you never killed the monsters in the first place
the valiant ainsley, saving his poor itty bitty kitty from the terrible storm !!!
me when the genderneutral pronoun i used because i don't know the gender !! ( it's easier than saying "his/her" )
much better now that i think about it
nuh uh you're ainsley
i appreciate you too :3
because one non-fun haver complained about our excessive joy
and the other classmates apparently don't know what humor is, but they and the teacher said the points we made throughout the presentation were good
and we were laughing so hard at the conclusion
me and my friend had a little class project about comparing two poems that we read
me drawing the same thing over and over again on the whiteboard
i keep drawing it though
one time my civics teacher said a student in a different period said that the pineapple i drew ( that one taunt the toppin has ) creeped her out
one time, idk if i told you before but
me and my friend had a little class project about comparing two poems that we read
well the whole class did but
we were partners and on the last slide of the powerpoint we made
we put the HD lario image as the bg
now if it was somebody like a meteorologist who made that claim ( and didn't have tiktok cuz let's be honest, there is no way you're a good anything with tiktok installed ) i might be a little scared
i don't usually play Rain World but i like the characters
idk why but i always find it pretty funny when I'm watching somebody play pig city for the first time, then when they get back to peppino they go straight to the taxi without even noticing that there is stuff under the floor and then they are just like "where's the tower treasure?"
why, I must thank you for this wonderful response to my very own artwork. my endless gratitude be upon you
which then again, i traced the original image, but I think i'll just make a new thing
